1. Obtain the elements of the union between two character vectors.
vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[10:32,]))

2. Get those elements that are common to both vectors.
vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[10:32,]))

3. Get the difference of the elements between two character vectors.
vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[10:32,]))
